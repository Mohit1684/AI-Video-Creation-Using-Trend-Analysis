# AI-Driven News Video Creation Pipeline 🎥📰

Welcome to the future of news content creation! This project seamlessly automates the entire workflow of turning trending news into engaging videos — from trend discovery and personalized scriptwriting to audio generation and realistic lip-syncing visuals.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Creating timely, unique, and compelling news videos can be a challenging, multi-step process. Content creators often spend hours researching trends, crafting scripts, recording audio, and syncing video visuals.

**This project changes the game by automating all these steps in a smart, customizable pipeline:**

- **Trending News Discovery:**  
  Using the powerful [GNews API](https://gnews.io/), it fetches the latest trending news stories across various countries and categories.

- **Sentiment-Aware Script Generation:**  
  Leveraging the Groq API with the advanced **LLaMA 3.3 70B Versatile** model, it generates scripts tailored to a user-selected tone — be it angry, analytical, negative, or any other sentiment. This ensures every creator’s unique voice shines through, preventing content clashes.

- **Dynamic Audio Synthesis:**  
  Planned for the next phase — users will be able to select male or female voices, with scripts converted to natural-sounding speech using **Edge-TTS** technology.

- **Realistic Lip-Sync Video Creation:**  
  By integrating the popular **Wav2Lip** repository and **FFmpeg**, users can upload any image and merge it with the generated audio to create a video of the image realistically lip-syncing the spoken content.
